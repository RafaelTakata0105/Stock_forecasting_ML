# Stock_forecasting_ML

 ### Introduction
 
Financial markets are inherently complex, noisy, and non-linear systems, making accurate forecasting of asset prices one of the most challenging and valuable problems in quantitative finance. The ability to predict future stock prices or returns, even over a short horizon, is crucial for developing profitable trading strategies, managing risk, and optimizing investment portfolios.

Traditional time series models, such as ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), rely on strict statistical assumptions (like linearity and stationarity) that often fail to capture the subtle, long-range temporal dependencies and complex non-linear dynamics inherent in high-frequency financial data.


### Objective
This Jupyter Notebook aims to address these challenges by employing modern Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).
